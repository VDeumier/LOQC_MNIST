# LOQC_MNIST

*For the code to run, you first have to download the CSV of the mnist dataset that can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv, and put the csvs in the folder*

## Goal

The goal of this repository is to upgrade a neural network (NN) trained on the MNIST digit dataset by using Linear Optical Quantum Computing (LOQC). This approach aims to enhance the performance and capabilities of the neural network through quantum computing techniques.
