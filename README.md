# LOQC_MNIST

This repository has been create in the context of the Perceval Quest, a quantum computing challenge create by Quandela and Scaleway.

## Goal

The goal of this repository is to upgrade a neural network (NN) trained on the MNIST digit dataset by using Linear Optical Quantum Computing (LOQC). This approach aims to enhance the performance and capabilities of the neural network through quantum computing techniques.

## LOQC

The photonics algorithms are created using the Perceval library (see documentation here: https://perceval.quandela.net/docs/v0.11/index.html)
